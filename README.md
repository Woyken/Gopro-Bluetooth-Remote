# GoPro bluetooth remote

Control your GoPro quickly via Bluetooth.

[Try it out here](https://woyken.github.io/Gopro-Bluetooth-Remote/)

For those times when your GoPro is mounted and in some inconvenient place, and you can't check if it's on or need to change current video mode.

Official GoPro app takes way too long to connect to GoPro to control it. It's connecting via WiFi and phone takes few seconds each time to switch WiFi networks.

## Warning

It's only tested with GoPro **Hero 7 Black**. I don't have other GoPros to try out, so I can't be sure if it works, might work on Hero 5 - 8.

GoPro has introduced [OpenGoPro](https://gopro.github.io/OpenGoPro/ble_1_0) specification but it's only meant for Hero 9 and onwards, most of the functions and settings don't work for Hero 7.
