Going through settings one by one, enabling protune, changing setting values and all that jazz...
These are some findings
TODO proper formatting...


If we join these with official table:
https://gopro.github.io/OpenGoPro/ble_1_0#settings-quick-reference
we'll have pretty good settings coverage.

I'm guessing they are working on new versions of these settings that will be published to OpenGoPro.
Current findings feel quite hacky and/or messy at times
some of them are reused, while a lot of them have exact same values, but are saved in different setting.

I am only sure that the following settings are available for HERO 7 Black, can't say anything regarding other devices.

92 = 255 when invalid mode is selected, like sending command to change video mode to (0x03,0x02,0x01,0x06), while 0x04 should be max, then UI breaks in video category, can't change mode until you change category and go back
